# American-Baseball


In this project, 
- I will import data in SQLite, 
- design a normalized database schema, 
- create tables for the schema,
- and finally insert data into the schema

I will be working with a file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet.

Please check the "baseball.ipynb" file above.
